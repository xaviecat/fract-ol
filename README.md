## About the project
The `fract-ol` project is part of the 42 curriculum, focusing on creating graphically beautiful fractals using the MiniLibX library. It introduces students to 2D programming and the mathematical beauty of fractals.

### Key Requirements
- Implement various fractal algorithms (Julia set, Mandelbrot set).
- Provide interactive controls for zooming and navigating the fractals.
- Ensure the program runs efficiently and handles user inputs smoothly.

### Skills learned
- Advanced C programming.
- Graphics programming with MiniLibX.
- Mathematical concepts related to fractals.
- Memory management and optimization techniques.

### Bonus features
- One or more different fractals
  - Burning Ship
  - Newton fractal
  - Nova fractal
  - Inverted Mandelbrot
  - Julia set and Mandelbrot set at different power (2 to 12)
- The zoom follows the actual mouse position. 
- In addition to the zoom: moving the view by pressing the arrows keys. 
- Make the color range shift.
