  <p>Discover 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals in this project, using minilibX.</p>
</div>

## About the project
This will be the opportunity for you to get familiar with the MiniLibX, to discover or use the mathematical notion of complex numbers, to take a peek at the concept of optimization in computer graphics and practice event handling.

### Mandatory part
The program must offer the Julia set and the Mandelbrot set.
- The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the
computer). This is the very principle of fractals.
- The program must be able to create different Julia.
- A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal will be
displayed in a window.
  - The program can handle more parameters to use them as rendering options.
  - If no parameter is provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program displays
a list of available parameters and exits properly.
- The program must use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal. Itâ€™s even
better if you hack away on psychedelic effects.


### Skills learned
- Advanced C programming.
- Graphics programming with MiniLibX.
- Mathematical concepts related to fractals.
- Memory management and optimization techniques.

- One or more different fractals
  - Burning Ship
  - Newton fractal
  - Nova fractal
  - Inverted Mandelbrot
  - Julia set and Mandelbrot set at different power (2 to 10)
- The zoom follows the actual mouse position. 
- In addition to the zoom: moving the view by pressing the arrows keys. 
- Make the color range shift.
